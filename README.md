# Healthylinkx-chat-app

Healthylinkx helps you find doctors with the help of your social network. Think of Healthylinkx as a combination of Yelp, Linkedin and Facebook.

This is an early prototype that combines open data of doctors and specialists from the US Department of Health. It allows you to search for doctors based on location, specialization, genre or name. 

Healthylinx is a classic three tiers app: front-end (ux), service API and data store. This architecture makes it very adequate to test different technologies and I use it for getting my hands dirty on new stuff.

This repo implements Healthylinkx using an LLM as the front end. For each tier of the app, we use different AWS resources: RDS for the datastore, Lambda for the API and web app connected to Bedrock for the front-end.

To know more about the datastore this repo has more details https://github.com/mulargui/healthylinkx-mysql.git
Likewise about the API using Lambda https://github.com/mulargui/healthylinkx-serverless.git

This repo is based and adapted from previous work to build a LLM chat app  https://github.com/mulargui/bedrock-chat-app.git

In this repo we added the HealthyLinkx datastore and extended the lambda to search in the HealthyLinkx datastore. Most of the code added for this purpose is from https://github.com/mulargui/healthylinkx-chatgpt-plugin

The interesting code is at /lambda/src/index.js where we added code to invoke external tools and at /lambda/src/healthylinkx.js where we implemented to call to the healthyLinkx datastore. This code can easily be extended to include more external tools (ie web search...) or more Healthylinkx tools (ie doctor booking...)

Here is an example of a conversation. To note that the details about Brock are not coming from the HealthyLinkx datastore, they are provided by the LLM.
